Gym system is an interactive kiosk client system in which users can set their exercise plan and goal. Aim to motivate people to exercise more frequently.
In this progress, we are propose several documents as follows:
The final version of project plan document and related appendixes.
A ZIP file comprising source-code and all related material to our product.
 1) The ZIP file of source-code.
 2) A summary documents
 3) Guideline for running and implementing the system.
 4) A vedio to describes the basic functionality and implemented features

Project Plan
The project plan is a formal document used to guide both project execution and project control. Admittedly, this project plan is agreed by all of us and discussed in the final meeting.
The project plan is illustrates the background of our project and the whole task of the project. Besides, we list the resources we obtain in this project with a blameless implementation plan.
To the whole 3 month, we make a schedule plan and try to strictly obey what is planned. There are some unsteady floatation in real application.
Source-code.

For the source-code, we will give a zip file of code and along with our Github account as well.
